# Program 1
This project will give you practice using operations on integers, conditions, and selection (if) statements.

For full credit it must be completed no later than __6:00 am  on Monday, Feb. 8__. You may turn the program in up to two days late __6:00am on Wednesday, Feb. 10 for -30 points__. No programs will be accepted after that time so do not wait until the last minute to get started.  

Writing programs usually take longer than you think so get started as soon as you can!
